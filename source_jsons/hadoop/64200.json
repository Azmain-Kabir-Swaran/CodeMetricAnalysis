S3A Delegation Token extension point to use StoreContext.\n\nContributed by Steve Loughran.\n\nThis is part of the ongoing refactoring of the S3A codebase, with the\ndelegation token support (HADOOP-14556) no longer given a direct reference\nto the owning S3AFileSystem. Instead it gets a StoreContext and a new\ninterface, DelegationOperations, to access those operations offered by S3AFS\nwhich are specifically needed by the DT bindings.\n\nThe sole operation needed is listAWSPolicyRules(), which is used to allow\nS3A FS and the S3Guard metastore to return the AWS policy rules needed to\naccess their specific services/buckets/tables, allowing the AssumedRole\ndelegation token to be locked down.\n\nAs further restructuring takes place, that interface\u0027s implementation\ncan be moved to wherever the new home for those operations ends up.\n\nAlthough it changes the API of an extension point, that feature (S3\nDelegation Tokens) has not shipped; backwards compatibility is not a\nproblem except for anyone who has implemented DT support against trunk.\nTo those developers: sorry.\n\nChange-Id: I770f58b49ff7634a34875ba37b7d51c94d7c21da\n",
